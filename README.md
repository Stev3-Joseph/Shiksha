# Shiksha
Our Site provides a wholesome development environment for young students. The test is curated by selecting questions based on multiple categories such as logical, verbal, non verbal and comprehension skills. The learning level of the students are then assessed by a Machine learning model which also provides suggestions to users. The project aims to improve learning rates of students and reduce early dropout from schools.
